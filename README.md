# My-scheduler
I have a very busy schedule, so I created a daily planner to organize my day, add my appointments, and I could also add reminders of important events or birthdays. It is very important to have a planner or organizer for your day. I used Days.Js library, and it helped me a lot with the date and time. And I think I will search for different libraries next time, because I realized that every library will add different taste to my work and take my code to a different level.
